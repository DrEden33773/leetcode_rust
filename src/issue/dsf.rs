//! Sometimes, we need to keep track of k disjoint groups of
//! items â€” meaning that each each item uniquely belongs to one group.
//! The most common operations that we'd like to run on our collection of groups are:
//! find_set(x) which tells us which of our k groups u belongs to and union(s1, s2)
//! which allows us to merge two groups. Remember in the section on connected
//! components we needed to quickly find out if a node was already part of some component.
